# wasm-climate-model

<h3><a href="http://aliramadhan.me/wasm-climate-model/">Launch WASM climate model!</a></h3>

A work-in-progress attempt to put an interactive climate model (or general circulation model) in the browser for educational purposes. Idea is to probably code the computationally intensive parts in Rust then compile to WebAssembly (wasm) and run it in the browser using three.js to visualize the solution on a globe.
